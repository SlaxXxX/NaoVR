## Time Management
Total: 150 Hrs

Technically left after estimation: 18 hr

#### Topics:

Topic | Time Estimation | Assignee | Comment
--- | --- | --- | ---
Setup / Learn to use ROS, UE, Nao, other | 30 hr | |
Test Nao Camera, Try to stream to PC | 10 hr max | | Would not waste more time than nessecary on this, external hardware is better anyways
Find and setup suitable video hardware | 10 hr | | If Nao’s camera does not meet expectations
Get Vive Hardware to track in virtual world | 2 hr | | Should be easy with unreal engine
Calculate user pose from tracked Vive | 30 hr | | Still looking for a keyword here i picked up a while ago (something with skeleton)
Get Nao to move | 10 hr | | Try to send move commands live to the nao wirelessly
Move Nao’s head to Vive tracked position | 20 hr | | Head seems like a good start. Can’t break anything, most vital part of system as camera is essential for good immersion
Move Nao’s arms to Vive tracked position | 20 hr | |

## Potential Topics:
- Motionsickness. Causes and solutions
- How to keep Nao in Balance. (important for feet tracked walking)
